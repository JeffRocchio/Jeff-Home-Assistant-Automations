I managed to get this working by following a different approach, as described below.

   1. I noticed that ESPHome Builder, on the HA Raspberry Pi, did create a 'card' for the device I am trying to create. And in the 3-dots menu for that device it offered an option to 'download' the .elf file. So I did, downloading the file *poc-pico-w.elf* to a folder on my Linux desktop.

   2. After googling around I learned about .elf and uf2 files and the roles each play with respect to microcontrollers, esp the RP2040 picos.

   3. As part of the above many folks pointed to an elf2uf2 converter utility available on github: [JustAnother1 * elf2uf2](https://github.com/JustAnother1/elf2uf2). I cloned that repo locally and compiled the the C source to make an executable binary for myself.

   4. I ran the now compiled elf2uf2 utility against my downloaded .elf file, and, indeed, it created a UF2 file as output. (Command used for this: `./elf2uf2 -f 0xe48bff56 -p 256 -i poc-pico-w.elf`)

   5. Holding the BOOTSEL button down in my Pico board, I then plugged it into my Linux desktop machine. As expected, it mounted and opened as a storage drive on my desktop.

   6. I dragged and dropped the newly created *poc-pico-w.uf2* file onto that drive. After a few seconds the drive 'disappeared' from my desktop - as expected, which indicated a successful upload of the ESPHome firmware onto the Pico. (The Pico saw the new uf2 file, 'installed' it onto itself, then automatically rebooted and started running the ESPHome firmware. None of which you see on the desktop other than the condition that Pico no longer appears on the desktop as an open storage device.)

   7. Leaving the Pico plugged into my desktop's USB port, so that it has power and is running, I go into the Home Assistant panel and, vola!, I see it is offering to add my new ESPHome *Proof of Concept - Pico W* device. Which I do with no errors reported.

OK then, so I have it working now. And the firmware the ESPHome Builder created was good. But, of course, the question remains as to why I wasn't able to find any way to get it uploaded via the Builder, inside of HA itself, as part of the designed 'build/install' process.

But, at least for me, I now have a way to construct my Pico based ESPHome custom devices. So that's cool.
