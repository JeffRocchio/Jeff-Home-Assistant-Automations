[Enable HTTPS using Let’s Encrypt in Home Assistant](https://theprivatesmarthome.com/how-to/enable-https-using-lets-encrypt-in-home-assistant/)

> Connections between Tailscale nodes are secured with end-to-end encryption. Browsers, web APIs, and products like Visual Studio Code are not aware of that, however, and can warn users or disable features based on the fact that HTTP URLs to your tailnet services look unencrypted since they’re not using TLS certificates, which is what those tools are expecting.
