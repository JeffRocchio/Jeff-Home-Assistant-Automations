# ELEMENT OF: LIGHT-SET VIRTUAL OBJECT
# This script turns a light-set's delay transition timer off.
# This script is also a component of my 'Day-Dim' mini-application.

# ==== Change Log ==============================================================
# 2025-04-26: Fixed an error in the light_map label strings
# 2025-04-23: Update lightset_map to the naming conventions
# 2025-04-07: Works in initial tests

    **Member Of**: *Light-Set / Day-Dim App.* ||
    Utility to turn a light-set's timer off. Using a seperate script for this
    as I believe I will end up needing to turn the timer off from several
    different automations and scripts. So for me it's best to have this simple
    utility I can call from anywhere and be consistent. ||
    Must pass in the field/variable *lightset_label* which defines the
    light-set instance to operate on.

  # ==== Params in from calling automation or script ===========================
  fields:
    lightset_label:
      description: Label passed in by caller
      example: Light Set - Day Dim | Kitchen
      required: true

  # ==== Internal variables used in this script ================================
  variables:
    # This is copy/paste in from CODE_SNIP_Lightset-Map.yaml
    lightset_map:
      "NoLabel":
        delay_timer_helper: "NoTimer"

      "Light-Set - Day-Dim | Test Set":
        delay_timer_helper: "timer.lightset_test_set_timer"

      "Light-Set - Day-Dim | Living Area":
        delay_timer_helper: "timer.lightset_living_area_timer"

      "Light-Set - Day-Dim | Kitchen":
        delay_timer_helper: "timer.lightset_kitchen_timer"

    lset_timer_helper: "{{ lightset_map[lightset_label].delay_timer_helper | default('NoTimer') }}"

  # ==== Take action ===========================================================

  # NOTE: Should probably wrap this in a condition block using
  # "{{ lightset_timer != "NoTimer" }}"
  # NOTE: timer.cancel resets the duration to the last known initial value
  # without firing the timer.finished event.
  sequence:
    - alias: "Cancel the delay timer for the light-set"
      action: timer.cancel
      metadata: {}
      data: {}
      target:
        entity_id: "{{ lset_timer_helper }}"
