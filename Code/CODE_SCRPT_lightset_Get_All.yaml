# ELEMENT OF: LIGHT-SET VIRTUAL OBJECT
# ==== Change Log ==============================================================
# 2025-06-01: Initial implementation. Works as designed.

lightset_get_all:
  alias: Lightset - Get the Dictionary of All Lightsets
  description: >
    **Member Of**: *Light-Set / Day-Dim App.* <br>
    **Purpose**: Act as a 'getter' function to retrieve the label and
    attributes for all light-sets as a 2-level dictionary. This is useful for
    iterating over all lightsets (e.g., to cancel all timers, reset states,
    etc.). Implementing as a getter script for a level of indirection so that
    future changes and enhancements won't be brittle.
