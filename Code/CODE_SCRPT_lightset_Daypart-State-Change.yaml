# 05/04/2025: Initial creation.
lightset_daypart_state_change:
  alias: Light Set | Daypart State Change
  description: >-
    **Member Of**: *Light-Set / Day-Dim App.* ||
    **Purpose**: Upon the occurance of a change in state to the Daypart
    sensor, force a call to the 'lightset_Assess-Conditions' script
    for each sensor's light-set so that Daypart transitiions will be cause
    the appropriate day-dim actions to occur.
    **Note**: This script needs to be called by an automation that
    triggers on the appropriate Daypart state changes. The calling automation
    must pass in the variable: 'new_state'

  fields:
    new_state:
      description: "The new state of the Daypart sensor"
      required: true

  variables:
    # The list below is defined in the form that it is based on ChatGPT:
    # Home Assistant’s template engine really wants a plain YAML list in
    # for_each, not a dict, and it won’t magically turn your map’s keys into
    # one for you. The most fool-proof pattern is to define your light-sets as
    # a list of objects up front, then loop over that list:
    lightset_list:
      - label: "Light-Set - Day-Dim | Test Set"
        state_helper: input_select.lightset_test_set_state

      - label: "Light-Set - Day-Dim | Living Area"
        state_helper: input_select.lightset_living_area_state

      - label: "Light-Set - Day-Dim | Kitchen"
        state_helper: input_select.lightset_kitchen_state

  sequence:
    - alias: Take appropriate action based on new Daypart state
      choose:
        # ----CASE-1 ------
        - alias: 1. Daypart went to Day
          conditions:

                {{ new_state == 'Day' }}
          sequence:

              repeat:
